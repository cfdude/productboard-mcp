  - Resolved `"expected": "string", "received": "object"` parsing errors in Claude Code integration
  - Enhanced `formatResponse` function calls to ensure proper string serialization for MCP protocol

- **‚ö° TypeScript Compilation Issues**
  - Fixed `formatResponse` function parameter mismatches causing TypeScript build errors
  - Resolved incorrect function signatures where 3-parameter calls were made to 2-parameter functions
  - Fixed all "Expected 3 arguments, but got 1" TypeScript errors

- **üìù Enhanced Error Messages**
  - Improved HTML validation error messages to show exact allowed tags: `<b>`, `<i>`, `<s>`, `<u>`, `<br>`, `<a>`, `<code>`, `<img>`
  - Enhanced error guidance for description fields that require HTML formatting
